I want to build a standalone application that follows the pattern of  GNU Radio Companion and similar applications that present an extensible list of objects in a palette that can be dragged and dropped onto a canvas or workspace.

The entire interface should have a menu, a toolbar, and a status bar.  It must be realizable to fit the screen, minimizeable, or hidden.

The toolbar should have buttons for "New", "Save", "Save As".
The menubar should have conventional drop-downs for "File", "Edit", "Tools", and "Help".

The pallet will present objects made available in a file named palette_objects.json.  This file will contain minimal descriptions of objects including the object's guid, a unique hash of the object's definition file to maintain integrity, the name to be displayed under the object in the palette and on the workspace, and an ordinal number that indicates where the palette entry is located in the palette. There should also be a reference to an .svg file that will appear on the palette button's surface for selection.

The objects themselves will be defined in individual <*>_obj.json where <*> represents a same guid that references it in the palette_objects.json file. All of these object definition files should be stored in a directory "./obj" relative to the project's root.

Internally, the object files will contain JSON objects that list the object's source connectors, sink connectors, and snippets of executable Javascript code that may define actions performed on the sink and source entry when data is processed.

The overall interface will be able to open and save, and close files located in the directory "./projects" (relative to the project root).
Project files will be named <*>_prj.json and the names will be unique.
These files will contain JSON format lists of the objects in the workspace, their relative position within the workspace and their source and sink targets (targets may be multiple).

Upon loading a particular *_prj.json file, the system will close any previously open project file, clear the workspace canvas, Load the new file, and position its objects according their stored locations and connect any source and sink connectors using narrow bezier lines with small arrowheads showing data flow direction.  This representation should reflect the state at the time it was last saved.
